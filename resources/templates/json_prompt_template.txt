Write a flat JSON object describing the doctor in the given input sentence.

In general, your output should look like:

```json
{
    "some_feature": "foo",
    "another_feature": "bar",
    ...
    "last_feature": "baz"
}
```

There are seven features we would like to extract from the sentence:

- "first_name" (the doctor's first name)
- "last_name" (the doctor's last name)
- "c2z3" (a code of the form XX-YYY where XX are letters and YYY are digits)
- "address" (the doctor's office address, "line 1" -- this is the street address)
- "address2" (additional address information giving a suite number, unit number, et cetera -- "line 2" of the address)
- "specialty" (the doctor's specialty)
- "legal_name" (the legal name of the doctor's business, practice, or employer)

Please generate a key-value pair for every such value specified in the sentence. Avoid nulls and empty strings. Omit any missing values. Do not write a script. Output the JSON itself directly with no preamble or commentary. The following examples illustrate how you should behave on the input sentence.

{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Smith", "specialty": "neurology", "legal_name": "Happy Brain Services LLC", "address": "512 Example Street", "c2z3": CA-170"}
```
