Write a flat JSON object describing a doctor who is named in the given input sentence.

In general, your output should look like:

```json
{
    "some_feature": "foo",
    "another_feature": "bar",
    ...
    "last_feature": "baz"
}
```

There are seven features we would like to extract from the sentence:

- "first" (the doctor's given name, e.g., Susan, Jason, Mark, Jane)
- "last" (the doctor's surname, e.g., Smith, Harris, Newman, Johnson)
- "specialty" (the doctor's specialty)
- "legal_name" (the legal name of the doctor's business, practice, or employer)
- "city_name" (the city where the doctor's office is)
- "zip" (the ZIP code of the doctor's office)
- "addr" (the doctor's office address, "line 1" -- this is the street address)

Please generate a key-value pair for every such value specified in the sentence. Avoid nulls and empty strings. Omit any missing values. If the sentence calls the doctor "Dr. John Smith," include both the given name (as `"first"`) and surname (as `"last"`). If the sentence calls the doctor "Dr. Smith," include only the surname (as `"last"`). Do not write a script. Output the JSON itself directly with no preamble or commentary. The following examples illustrate how you should behave on the input sentence.
