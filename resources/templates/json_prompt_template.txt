Write a flat JSON object describing one of the doctors in the given input sentence.

In general, your output should look like:

```json
{
    "some_feature": "foo",
    "another_feature": "bar",
    ...
    "last_feature": "baz"
}
```

There are eight features we would like to extract from the sentence:

- "first" (the doctor's first name)
- "last" (the doctor's last name)
- "specialty" (the doctor's specialty)
- "legal_name" (the legal name of the doctor's business, practice, or employer)
- "city" (the name of the city where the doctor practices)
- "zip" (the ZIP code where the doctor practices)
- "addr" (the doctor's office address, "line 1" -- this is the street address)
- "addr2" (additional address information giving a suite number, unit number, et cetera -- "line 2" of the address)

Please generate a key-value pair for every such value specified in the sentence. Avoid nulls and empty strings. Omit any missing values. Do not write a script. Output the JSON itself directly with no preamble or commentary. The following examples illustrate how you should behave on the input sentence.
