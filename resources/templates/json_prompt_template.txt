Write a flat JSON object describing one of the doctors in the given input sentence.

In general, your output should look like:

```json
{
    "some_feature": "foo",
    "another_feature": "bar",
    ...
    "last_feature": "baz"
}
```

There are eight features we would like to extract from the sentence:

- "first" (the doctor's given name)
- "last" (the doctor's surname)
- "specialty" (the doctor's specialty)
- "legal_name" (the legal name of the doctor's business, practice, or employer)
- "city_name" (the city where the doctor's office is)
- "zip" (the ZIP code of the doctor's office)
- "addr" (the doctor's office address, "line 1" -- this is the street address)
- "addr2" (additional address information giving a suite number, unit number, et cetera -- "line 2" of the address)

Please generate for each feature a key-value pair corresponding to the information given in the sentence. If the sentence doesn't specify a feature, simply output `null`. If the sentence calls the doctor "Dr. John Smith," include both the given and surname (`"first"` and `"last"`). If the sentence calls the doctor "Dr. Smith," include only the surname (`"last"`). Do not write a script. Output the JSON itself directly with no preamble or commentary. The following examples illustrate how you should behave on the input sentence.
